# Connect4
The code is a game Connect 4. It allows two players to take turns placing their red or black pieces on a normal connect four grid. The program validates the chosen column, places the piece in the lowest available position in that column, and checks for a winning condition after each move. The game continues until a player connects four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the grid is completely filled, resulting in a tie game. The game can be played after going to the command input and typing "javac Connect4.java" This will generate a Connect4.class file. Then typing "java Connect4" to begin the class.
